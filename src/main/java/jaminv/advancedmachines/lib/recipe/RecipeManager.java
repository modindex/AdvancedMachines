 * Recipe Manager Interface Definition
 * 
 * `MachineRecipeManager` is the de facto implementation of this interface, and should work for most purposes.
 * This still exists as a generic interface, however, in case there is something that it can't handle.
 * Auto-crafting machines, for example, can't be handled by `MachineRecipeManager`.
 * 
 * External code should use `IRecipeManger` as the variable type rather than a specific implementation.
