/**
 * Expose Machine Storage Capabilities
 * 
 * This is a thin wrapper that is tightly coupled to `MachineStorage` that's used for exposing
 * capabilities. It blocks a few item transfer capabilities that you wouldn't want logistic devices
 * having access to, but players should be allowed to do. This class prevents logistics systems from
 * removing items from input slots and from adding items to output slots.
 * 
 * Although I don't particularly like tightly coupling this object, doing so prevented a lot of 
 * duplicate code (mostly just wrapper functions, but there are a lot of them).
